# Chat
This is a chat project within the skillfactory C++ cource.
The chat has two parts of the program: client part and server part.
Both parts has a TCP realization. 
Functional of the server and the client are reperesents as classes.
Logic of interraction between server and client is that a server should not keep a state of a client after the request from the client is proccessed.
With this logic the server part can work with many open clients applications.
