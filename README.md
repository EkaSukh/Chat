# Chat
This is a chat project within the skillfactory C++ cource.
The chat has two parts of the program: client part and server part.
Both parts have a TCP realization. 
Functionality of the server and the client are reperesented as classes.
Logic of interraction between the server and a client is that the server should not keep a state of a client after the request from the client is proccessed.
With this logic the server part can work with many open clients applications.
